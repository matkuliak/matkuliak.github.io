# Welcome to my docs!

These pages serve as a catalog of my work. 
It should be the second thing you look at after my CV or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matej-matkuliak/).

- **Example blog post** - Analysis of ingestion improvements with vertical/horizontal scaling: https://cratedb.com/blog/ingesting-with-cratedb
- **DocsOps** - Implemented the documentation solution and workflows for [Frinx](https://docs.frinx.io/)
  - Automated [release notes](https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/release-notes/), pulling info directly from dev [commits](https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/release-notes/uniconfig-6.1.2/). 

So far I've had a really diverse experience as a technical writer. As time went it
ranged from networking engineer to typical technical writer to content
manager and reviewer. I was comfortable in this hybrid position. It however
makes for a difficult explanation of what I do at times. Because of that, I
try to summarize my responsibilities by frequency below:

## My Responsibilities

### Routine tasks (daily to weekly occurrence) 

**Development of new documentation**—In the process, I test the product myself and communicate with both the product and development teams. Thanks to that, I have experience working on open-source projects with multiple collaborators, tracking everything in collaboration tools like Jira, GitHub Projects, etc.

I'm a big proponent of the docs-as-code approach. Most of my experience is in [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). However, it is slightly dated, depending on the use case, so when starting a fresh docs project, I like to use [Retype](https://retype.com/).

**Review** -  In my experience, developers also write documentation regularly. When this happens, I'm happy to help out.

**API development** - I regularly prepare and document API collections for internal training, new products, or even specific customer use cases.

**UX input** - Due to my hybrid role, I sometimes have a different perspective than a traditional developer which can lead to a UI adjustment or the introduction of a new feature.

**Analytics** - Keeping an eye on SEO, our numbers in Google Analytics, reception of new guides and updates, etc. Also included in our Ads focus and spending.

### Less frequent tasks (every couple of weeks to a couple of months) 

**Development of long-term content strategies.** - With multiple software products, content priorities shift based on the goals of the product and development teams. I also prioritize customer feedback, which significantly influences my focus areas.

**Releases** - Frinx used to write release notes manually together with product and developer teams. I automated that process. Standardization of commit messages, together with a few scripts, allowed us to pull release notes directly from Github commit history. E.g., https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/release-notes/uniconfig-5.0.7/

**Website management** - I managed a ReactJS website. Changes weren't needed often as it wasn't the main space for communication, but new content was added by me. https://frinx.io/

**Networking devices environment setup** - I worked in the networking lab at one of the jobs. Worked with multiple vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Ciena, Huawei, etc.). Thanks to my networking background I was often assigned to the beginning stages of projects. Get a sense of the scope of the project and the work that will be needed to be done.

**Design** - Experience in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign for promotional documents.

**DevOps** - Work with VMs (Proxmox), preparation of the environment, and allocation of resources. A good amount of work with dockerized applications (Docker/Kubernetes).

**CI/CD infrastructure** - I have experience with infrastructure work. Mainly Jenkins jobs for automated builds/tests and Artifactory for binaries storage.
