# Welcome to my docs!

These pages are supposed to serve as a showcase of my work. It should be the second thing you read after my CV or LinkedIn. It is an edited fork of [FRINX's github](https://github.com/FRINXio/frinxio.github.io) that I developed and maintain. Feel free to look around.

So far I had an interesting experience as a technical writer. As time went it ranged from networking engineer to typical technical writer to content manager and reviewer. I was comfortable in this hybrid position. It however makes for a difficult explanation of what I do at times. Because of that, I try to summarize my responsibilities by frequency below:

## My Responsibilities

### Routine tasks (daily to weekly occurrence) 

**Development of new documentation** - In the process, I test the product myself and communicate with both product and development teams. Thanks to that I have experience in working on open-source projects with multiple collaborators. Tracking everything in collaboration tools like Jira.

For the documentation I like to use Retype. It allows to focus more on the content and less on the html and css. It's a tool that automatically generates beautiful pages from markdown code. It can also be configured to build and deploy every new commit automatically.

**Review** -  In my experience, developers also write documentation regularly. When this happens, everything goes through me. We've put together a very solid review process to make the workflow as straightforward as it can be.

**API development** - I regularly prepare and document API collections for internal training, new products or even for specific customer use-cases.

**UX input** - Due to my hybrid role I sometimes have a different perspective than a traditional developer which can lead to a UI adjustment or to the introduction of a new feature.

**Analytics** - Keeping an eye on our numbers in Google Analytics, reception of new guides and updates etc. Also included in our Ads focus and spending - Not a main guy on this but I was frequently included for input. 

### Less frequent tasks (every couple of weeks to a couple of months) 

**Development of long-term content strategies.** We have multiple software products and content-related priorities need to shift in accordance with the priorities of product and development teams. Customer feedback is also a high priority for me, so that too influences what I focus on.

**Releases** - We used to write release notes manually together with product and developer teams. I automated that process. Standardization of commit messages together with a script allowed us to pull release notes directly from Github commit history. E.g., https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/release-notes/uniconfig-5.0.7/

**Website management** - I managed a ReactJS website. Changes weren't needed often as it wasn't main space for communication, but new content was added by me. https://frinx.io/

**Networking devices environment setup**- Products dealt with networking devices. I've worked with multiple vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Ciena, Huawei etc.). Thanks to my networking background I was often assigned to the beginning stages of projects. Get a sense of the scope of the project and the work that will be needed to be done.

**Design** -Experience in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign for promotional documents.

**DevOps** - Work with VMs, preparation of the environment, allocation of resources. Also some Docker experience with debugging.

**CI/CD infrastructure** - I have experience with infrastructure work. We use mainly Jenkins jobs for automated builds/tests and Artifactory for binaries storage.
