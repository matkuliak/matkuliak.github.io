# Welcome to my docs!

These pages are supposed to serve as a showcase of my work. It should be the second thing you read after my CV or LinkedIn. It is an edited fork of [FRINX's github](https://github.com/FRINXio/frinxio.github.io) that I developed and maintain. Feel free to look around.

So far I had an interesting experience as a technical writer. As time went it ranged from networking engineer to typical technical writer to content manager and reviewer. I was comfortable in this hybrid position. It however makes for a difficult explanation of what I do at times. Because of that, I try to summarize my responsibilities by frequency below:

## My Responsibilities

### Routine tasks (daily to weekly occurrence) 

**Development of new documentation** - In the process, I test the product myself and communicate with both product and development teams.

**Review** - In my current job, developers also write documentation regularly. When this happens, everything goes through me. We've put together a very solid review process to make the workflow as straightforward as it can be. When I took the position of Lead Writer we transitioned to Github pages together with a code-based documentation generation tool. I've also set up GitHub actions (automated jobs) that make for convenient automatic deployment of new documentation.

**API development** - A number of our products are operated using API. I regularly prepare API collections for internal training, documentation or even specifically for customers.

**UX input** - Due to my role I sometimes have a different perspective than a regular developer. I often have input that can lead to a UI adjustment or the introduction of a new feature.

**Analytics** - Keeping an eye on our numbers in Google Analytics, reception of new guides and updates etc. Also included in our Ads focus and spending. Not a point guy on this but I was frequently included for input. 

### Less frequent tasks (every couple of weeks to a couple of months) 

**Development of long-term content strategies.** We have multiple software products and content-related priorities need to shift between them in accordance with the priorities of product and development teams. Customer feedback is also a high priority for us, so that too influences what I focus on.

**Releases** - Preparation of release notes with the cooperation of product and developer teams. E.g., https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-uniconfig/release-notes/uniconfig-4.2.10/

**Website management** - We have a ReactJS website that I manage. We don't update it terribly often as it's not our main space for communication, but new content is added by me. https://frinx.io/

**Networking devices environment setup**- We work with networking devices. I've worked with multiple vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Ciena, Huawei etc.). Thanks to my networking background I was often assigned to the beginning stages of projects. Get a sense of the scope of the project and the work that will be needed to be done.

**General DevOps** - Work with VMs, preparation of the environment, allocation of resources. Also some Docker experience with debugging.

**CI/CD infrastructure** - Not terribly often, but I have experience with infrastructure work. We use mainly Jenkins jobs for automation and Artifactory for binaries storage.
