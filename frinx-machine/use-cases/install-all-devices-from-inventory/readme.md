# Install all devices from inventory

Once you add multiple devices to your inventory, it can get tedious to install all of them individually. To make things easier, we built a workflow that will install all
devices present in the inventory. To use this workflow, follow these instructions:

On landing page go to `UniFlow` section, click `Explore` button and search for the workflow called **Install_all_from_inventory**.

Once searched click on `Execute` button (blue play icon). Window will pop up, where you would usually fill input parameters. This workflow however, doesn't take any input. So just click `Execute` again
and the workflow will start.

Once you execute, numeric link will appear left to the `Execute` button. It will take you to a page where you can see individual tasks of this workflow, its inputs/output and wheter it was successful or unsuccessful. In the "Input/Output" tab you can see both the devices that were installed as a result of this workflow and those that were already installed.
